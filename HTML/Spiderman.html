            Marvel's Spider-Man is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. 
            Based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, it tells an original narrative that is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology, 
            while also drawing from various adaptations in other media. In the main story, the super-human crime lord Mister Negative orchestrates 
            a plot to seize control of New York City's criminal underworld. When Mister Negative threatens to release a deadly virus, 
            Spider-Man must confront him and protect the city while dealing with the personal problems of his civilian persona, Peter Parker.
