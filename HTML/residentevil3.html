        <p class="Section--paragraph"> Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror third-person shooter video game that is played 
            from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective. Although the player controls Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine 
            through most of the game, certain sections require the player to control a supporting character, Carlos Oliveira, for short periods. 
            The player must explore the environment to open doors, climb up ladders, and pick up items. When an item is collected, 
            it is stored in an inventory that can be accessed at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, 
            and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. 
            The player may also pick up maps to reveal unexplored sections in the game's automap, 
            which shows the player's current position and indicates if an area still has items to collect. 
            Cutscenes with occasional quick time events are featured at regular intervals to advance the story.
