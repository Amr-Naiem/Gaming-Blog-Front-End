            Many years have passed since the titular God of War, Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods.
            Having survived his final encounter with his father Zeus,
            Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in Ancient Norway and now lives with his young son Atreus in the world
            of the Norse gods,
            a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors.
            In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos's second wife) has recently died,
            how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace
            his newfound role as a father and a mentor.

        <p class="Section--paragraph"> Atreus: The deuteragonist of the game. The son of Kratos and Faye, Atreus is a
            young boy who accompanies Kratos on his journey.
            He is taught how to hunt early in the game and is shown to be impulsive and undisciplined.
            He has the ability to read runic writings and is more knowledgeable about the world and its inhabitants than
            Kratos.
            He is unaware of the god status of Kratos. He is eventually revealed to be also named Loki, the mythological
            God of Mischief.
