      <p >The game begins&nbsp;<em>in medias res</em>&nbsp;with treasure hunter brothers&nbsp;Nathan "Nate" Drake&nbsp;(Nolan North) and&nbsp;Samuel "Sam" Drake&nbsp;(Troy Baker) driving toward an island in a storm while fighting off armed thugs in boats before their boat is scuttled. Years before, when Nate (Britain Dalton) is living in the St. Francis orphanage, he's visited by Sam (Chase Austin), who was kicked out for criminal activities. After helping him sneak out, Sam tells Nate he's leaving for a job that will keep him away for a few years, before cheering him up by telling him that he knows where their late mother's effects were sold.</p>
      <p >Years later (before the events of&nbsp;the first game), the two are on the trail of infamous pirate&nbsp;Henry Avery, who enacted the largest heist in history in the 1600s, with plunder worth 400 million dollars. Teaming up with wealthy treasure hunter&nbsp;Rafe Adler&nbsp;(Warren Kole), the brothers sneak into a Panama jail where Avery's first mate, Burnes, was hanged. Aided by the corrupt Warden&nbsp;Vargas&nbsp;(Hemky Madera), Nate makes his way into the 300 year-old prison. Vargas pulls out a letter, and discovers that the trio (Nate, Sam, and Rafe) are searching for Henry Avery's treasure, demands a cut, saying "I want in." Nate eventually sneaks into Burnes' tower cell, where he finds a crucifix. Nate lies to Vargas saying there weren't any clues or valuables. Nate meets up with Sam, later with Rafe. The trio finds a safe place to converse, realizing that Saint Dismas was the man on the crucifix, they discover that they are to go to Scotland next. When they are about to leave, Gustavo, who was beaten up by Nate earlier, comes in with his "friends". Eventually Gustavo gets the upper-hand when the guards come in. Vargas then discovers Nate lied, and brings him, Sam and Rafe into his office to talk. Rafe argues that "they're doing most of the work", and after a discussion, Vargas asks for a fourth of the 400 million dollars treasure. Vargas warns Rafe about not crossing him again, but Rafe stabs him to death but not before he can fire his gun, alerting the guards and forcing them to flee. Sam was assumed to have been killed in the attempt, leaving Nate so distraught that he gives up the search while Rafe continues without him at the Saint Dismas Cathedral from Scotland.</p>
