            <p style="color: white;"><strong>Kratos</strong> and his son <strong>Atreus</strong> sit in a canoe in the middle of a lake, listening intently to a disembodied head recount the tawdry and tragic dramas of the Norse gods. The head dishes with the gusto of a gossip columnist and the smoothness of a public radio host. Kratos and son show the orator respect, only interrupting with the occasional question for clarification. That this serene moment doesnâ€™t ring false, let alone veer into tedium, speaks to the tremendous heavy lifting done by the creators of&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>&nbsp;to shift the tone, the style and the expectations of one of the most beloved but also most violent and debaucherous franchises in modern games.</p>
    
            <p style="color: white;">Last we saw Kratos, he still enjoyed getting hammered on a bottle of red, participating in a well-lit orgy and slaying Greek gods in ways that a teenager might storyboard onto the back of a ruled notebook. He and his franchise thrived on adrenaline, any inner turmoil serving as a springboard for ultraviolence, rather than an emotional well to be drawn from. Times change, and the new&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, part sequel (the story continues from where it left off) and part reboot (the adventure is slower and the characterization more thoughtful), has more heroic ambitions for the notorious antihero.</p>
