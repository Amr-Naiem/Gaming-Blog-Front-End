            Many years have passed since the titular God of War, Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods. Having survived his final encounter with his father Zeus,
            Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in Ancient Norway and now lives with his young son Atreus in the world of the Norse gods,
            a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors.
            In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos's second wife) has recently died,
            how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace his newfound role as a father and a mentor.

    <h1 class="Section--title">A Spartan Never Lets His Back Hit The Ground.</h1>
    <p class="Section--paragraph"> Many years have passed since Kratos, a Spartan warrior and former Greek God of War, took his vengeance against the Greek Gods,
        and he now lives with his young son Atreus in ancient Norway in the realm of Midgard. The game begins after the death of the Jötunn warrior Faye,
        Kratos' second wife and Atreus' mother, whose last request was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the Nine Realms. Kratos and Atreus prepare a funeral pyre for her,
        mourn her death and soon go on a hunt as per Kratos' desire. However, much to Kratos' disappointment, Atreus proves his incompetence and lack of focus, making Kratos reconsider taking Atreus in his journey.
        Kratos is soon attacked by a mysterious stranger with godlike powers,
        and who cannot feel anything physically. After seemingly killing him, Kratos reluctantly takes Atreus with him and begins their journey.

        <p class="Section--paragraph"> Atreus: The deuteragonist of the game. The son of Kratos and Faye, Atreus is a young boy who accompanies Kratos on his journey.
            He is taught how to hunt early in the game and is shown to be impulsive and undisciplined.
            He has the ability to read runic writings and is more knowledgeable about the world and its inhabitants than Kratos.
            He is unaware of the god status of Kratos. He is eventually revealed to be also named Loki, the mythological God of Mischief.
